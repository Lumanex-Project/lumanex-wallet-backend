 *                              address will be ignored. Any following destinations will have
 *                              the given amount sent. For example, if your destinations array was

 *                              Then address2 would be sent 50, address3 would be sent 100,
 *                              and address1 would get whatever remains of the balance
 *                              after paying node/network fees.
